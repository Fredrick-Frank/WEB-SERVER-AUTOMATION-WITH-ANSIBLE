A SIMPLE SETUP OF A WEB SERVER USING ANSIBLE  (INFRASTRUCTURE AS A CODE) IAC.

* WHAT IS A WEB SERVER?
A web server is a software application or hardware device that serves content over the World Wide Web.
It handles requests from clients (typically web browsers) and delivers web pages, files, or other content in response to those requests.
Web servers are a fundamental component of the internet infrastructure and are responsible for hosting websites and web applications.

* Key features of web servers include:

1. HTTP Protocol Handling: Web servers communicate with clients using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or its secure variant, HTTPS.
They understand HTTP requests sent by clients and respond with the appropriate content.

2. Content Storage and Delivery: Web servers store files, web pages, images, videos, scripts, and other content that make up websites and web applications.
They deliver this content to clients upon request.

3. Request Handling: Web servers process incoming HTTP requests, determine the appropriate action to take (such as serving a file or executing a script), and generate HTTP responses to send back to clients.

4. Security: Web servers often include security features such as access control, encryption (for HTTPS), and protection against common web attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.

5. Performance and Scalability: Web servers are optimized for handling a large number of simultaneous connections and delivering content quickly and efficiently.
They may employ techniques such as caching, load balancing, and connection pooling to improve performance and scalability.

In conclusion, a web server is a computer system that hosts websites, and runs web server software such as Apache HTTP, IIS for windows. The hosts can be shared or dedicated.

** Shared Hosting: In shared hosting, multiple websites are hosted on the same server, and resources (such as CPU, memory, and storage) are shared among all the hosted websites. This means that resources are limited and may be affected by the activities of other websites on the same server.


** Dedicated Hosting: With dedicated hosting, a single server is exclusively allocated to a single client or website. All the server's resources are dedicated to that client, providing higher performance and more control over resource allocation.
